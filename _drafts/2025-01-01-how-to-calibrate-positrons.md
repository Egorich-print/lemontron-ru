Use your hand to put your tool end in the center rear position.
Put a piece of paper on the nozzle.
Lower the build plate by hand until the nozzle touches the paper.
Adjust so that the paper can be moved but has some drag to it. 
Now move the tool end to the front left and use the adjustment screw, same thing with the paper on the nozzle.
Repeat on the right.
Now move the tool end back to the back middle again and repeat to hone in the perfect level bed. Now the bed is physically level.
Next you have to open the Web UI, click home, let it home then put the paper between the nozzle again.
In the UI set the Z to 0, that will move the bed almost all the way down.
Use the Z offset buttons in the UI to finely adjust the bed up or down so that the paper just barely drags.
Press the save icon. 
From now on you dont ever have to calibrate z offset again and probably not level the bed either.
