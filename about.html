        <h1>Me</h1>
        <p>
            I’m James. I’ve been developing a 3D printer that powerful as it is portable. It fits neatly into
            a standard filament box, breaking boundaries and making it the perfect tool for makers on the go.

    <h1>Support Me</h1>
    <p>
        Let me be abundantly clear &mdash; developing a new product takes tons of money and MY FUNDS ARE NOT INFINITE!
        By backing me, you’ll be directly ensuring future development. Also, you can get your
        name in the videos this way.
