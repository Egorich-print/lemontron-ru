These tools are needed to build the Lemontron. You may already have some of them, but if not, you can buy them
through these Amazon affiliate links! Building this printer has been a fun experience, but costly for me, so please
also consider supporting me on Patreon.

## Screw Drivers

The Lemontron benefits from deep integration and thus only M3 (2mm Hex Bit) and a few M2.5 are used. I
recommend having a dedicated high quality M3 screwdriver, plus a bit for your drill.

## 3D Printing Tools

You will need a modern, enclosed 3D printer to print the Lemontron parts. The Creality K1C is a great choice. 240 grit
sandpaper for honing bottom surfaces. Razors for scraping. A craft knife for tidying blemishes. Supa glue for the
Lemonstruder parts (the "liquid" one not the thick one). Files for creating sharp interior corners.

## Electrical System Tools

A soldering iron is needed for soldering the edge connector and other wires. I personally love the TS80P. For the
motors, you'll need some wire cutters and a crimper. You may try your luck with a soldering iron but
it's not recommended.

</ul>

## Trimming Tools

The motor shafts and X-Axis rail must be shortened. A Dremel with a cutoff wheel is recommended. A belt sander or course
file is needed for trimming the PCB & 2 fans.
