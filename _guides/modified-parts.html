<p>
    Congrats, now that you have received all your parts, you can start cutting them up! I hope you bought spares. Just
    kidding, it's actually all really really easy.

{% assign items = site.bom | where:"modification",true %}

<ul>
    {% for item in items %}
    <li>
        <!--        <div class="image">-->
        <!--            <img src="/assets/bom/{{item.url | split: '/' | last}}.png"/>-->
        <!--        </div>-->
        <a href="{{item.url | relative_url}}">{{item.title}}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
