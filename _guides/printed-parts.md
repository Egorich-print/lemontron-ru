The Lemontron plastic parts can be printed on most enclosed printers such as Bambulab X1C. Right now, not many
Lemontrons have been created. You should post your settings and materials and the advantages to the Lemontron thread in
the Voxolite Discord so that they can become official recommendations.

## Slicer Settings

Here is everything you need to know about slicing the Lemontron parts:

1. Lemontron is fully designed for FDM and does not require supports.
2. To ensure dimensional accuracy, a **0.2mm layer height** and a **0.4mm nozzle** is recommended.
3. To avoid infill on 1mm thick vertical features like the top plates, ensure your are using 5 top layers and 5 bottom
   layers.
4. For an insanely buffed printer, use **50% Grid Infill** and **8 Perimeters**, and dial back according to your preference.
5. Using my settings will use 800-1000g of filament.

abilities with a flashy filament and upload your results to the photo album."

{% include inventory-item.html
title="Unibody Chassis"

description="You can print this in PLA, but ABS would be stronger. I would recommend PLA because its faster and when
you inevitably print new future Lemontron versions, you'd be wasting ABS."

matter."

{% include inventory-item.html
title="Lemonstruder"
id="lemonstruder"

also extremely small, so the excellent dimensional accuracy of CF-PET is good here. This could also be printed in
resin."

## Tool Head Inventory

<ul class="inventory">

wires in."
