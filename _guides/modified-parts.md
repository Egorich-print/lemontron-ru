Congrats, now that you have received all your off-the-shelf parts, it's time to modify them for the Lemontron. This guide will walk you through the process of modifying the parts.

## Motors

Cut all the motor shafts to 11mm. Precision is not required here.

## X-Axis

Cut the X-axis to 241mm. But you don't have to measure it, on one side of the X-axis, there is a hole. Simply cut the linear rail just barely to the hole. Precision is not required here.

## Lead Screw

You can forgo this step, and instead opt for the extra bit to stick out the bottom, doing nothing. But a full length lead screw will not allow the Z Axis assembly to fit within a filament box. Cut about 10mm off the lead screw, winding up around 225mm. Precision is not required here.

## Fans

For the part cooling fan, cut off and sand down the two mounting winglets and wire clip. For the heat break fan cut off the top left corner.
