For the past six months, I’ve been passionately working on this project with a single goal in mind: to create a 3D printer that is as versatile as it is portable. Lemontron is designed to fit neatly into a standard filament box, making it the perfect tool for anyone who values efficiency without compromising on quality.

Whether you’re a seasoned 3D printing enthusiast or just getting started, Lemontron offers something refreshing. It’s easy to assemble, disassemble, and store, without sacrificing the performance you expect from a full-sized 3D printer. With Lemontron, you can take your creativity anywhere.

# Support Lemontron on Patreon

Bringing Lemontron to life has been a labor of love, and I’m thrilled to share it with the world. But to continue refining this project and bringing it to as many people as possible, I need your support. By backing Lemontron on Patreon, you’ll be helping to fund ongoing development, new features, and the creation of more innovative tools like this. In return, you’ll gain access to exclusive content, early prototypes, and a community of like-minded creators.
