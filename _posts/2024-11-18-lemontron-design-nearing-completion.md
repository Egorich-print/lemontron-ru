Lemontron is a new Free and Open Source portable printer that is making the rounds online due to its unique form
factor-- But despite fitting in a box of filament, it sports a build plate comparable to a Bambulab A1 Mini.

The secret behind this incredible ratio is in the Drive system, which shares some similarities with CoreXY which
drives a ton of modern printers. However the exact drive system is known as the Positron drive, invented by YouTuber
"KRALYN" who released it in May of 2022.

Shortly after, Kralyn mysteriously went dark but the rest of the Positron team founded a business and went on to
bring the well received Positron v3.2 kit to market with LDO Motors as a manufacturer.

While heads down working on the v3.2, several forks sprung up, including the Positron JourneyMaker who beat the v3.2
to market, and the newcomer, the Lemontron. Lemontron also began as a unibody chassis mod for the JourneyMaker, but
quickly grew in scope into a complete redesign itself.

The Positron v3.2 and JourneyMaker are retail kits that integrate critical CNC parts. A fully built JourneyMaker
with a combination of self sourced parts and custom CNC parts from Voxolite Shop will cost you around $800, while
the Positron v3.2 kit from LDO motors will cost you $699.

In contrast, a fully built Lemontron consisting of only off-the-shelf parts will run you $413. If the price is any
indication, Lemontron is far ahead of the other Positrons. Being a complete redesign, all the custom CNC parts got
eliminated cleanly and without compromising the performance, resulting in a clean and no compromises redesign.

In a small printer you expect to see a small price and the Lemontron is certainly delivering on that expectation.

Video updates have been coming for the entire time and the latest one shows off the printer printing impressively
large structures, showing a comically large benchy followed by a particularly challenging marble run model
incorporating 80 degree unsupported overhangs which the Lemontron prints with ease.

The Lemontron is currently in the final stages of development and is expected to be released in the coming weeks,
with energetic video updates on the very last of the remaining todo items.
