Lemontron's official software stack is Mainsail OS on a Raspberry Pi.

## Prepare the SKR Pico

Install a jumper on to the `BOOT` pins on the SKR Pico (located in the center, under the "TE"in "BIGTREETECH"). Then,
hold down the `BOOT` button and connect the SKR
Pico to your computer. Drag [this firmware file](/assets/downloads/klipper.uf2) to the PICO drive that appears. Remove
the jumper. Good to go!

## Prepare the Raspberry Pi

Burn Mainsail OS via [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) onto your SD Card, ensuring you've
added your SSH key and WiFi settings.

Use SSH to access the Raspberry Pi's terminal and paste this:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
cd ~/klipper/
make menuconfig
```

In the menu interface that appears...

1. Change microcontroller architecture to RP2040
2. Change communication interface to Serial
3. Save Config
4. Run `make` in the terminal

## Configure Mainsail OS

1. Open up the Raspberry Pi webpage by navigating to the network name of the Raspberry Pi in your browser. If you named
   your printer "lemontron" then your URL would be `http://lemontron.local`
2. Update everything!
3. Click on the "Machine" tab (the last one) and upload [the config files](/assets/downloads/config-20241223-175652.zip).

## Install AutoHotspot

AutoHotspot is a script that will automatically switch your Raspberry Pi between WiFi and Hotspot mode based on the
presence of your home network.
Check out
the [AutoHotspot documentation](https://github.com/RaspberryConnect/AutoHotspot-Installer/tree/master/AutoHotspot-Setup/Autohotspot)
for more information.
