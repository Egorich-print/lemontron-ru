After a year of development, the affordable 3d printer for Australians is finally here, with a build plate that's upside
down, an ultra thin motion system mounted real low, and the flattest tool head you'll ever find.

Lemontron is the newest Positron-style printer, which means it's able to fold up and fit in a box of filament. It is the
most cost-reduced and refined version yet, with a fully 3d printed chassis that you can now print at home, because the
3MF and Fusion 360 project is now available to download!
