18 AWG silicone wire is a medium-gauge, highly flexible, and heat-resistant wire.

## AWG and Wire Diameter

- 18 AWG wire has a diameter of approximately 1.02 mm (0.0403 inches). It is a medium-thin wire, commonly used for applications that require moderate electrical current capacity.

## Electrical Specifications

- **Current Capacity:** Typically, 18 AWG wire can safely carry up to 16 amps in free air or 3-10 amps when enclosed, depending on insulation and operating conditions. However, silicone insulation can sometimes allow for slightly higher current due to its heat resistance.
