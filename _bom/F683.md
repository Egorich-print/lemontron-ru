An F683 bearing is a type of miniature ball bearing. Here’s a breakdown of what each part of the designation means:

### Applications:

F683 flanged bearings are commonly used in precision instruments, small motors, robotics, and other applications where space is limited, and precise bearing alignment is required. The flange helps in maintaining proper axial positioning without the need for additional components.

These bearings are also often used in hobby-grade 3D printers, drones, and other small-scale mechanical systems where small, precise, and low-friction rotation is needed.

1.	“F” - This indicates that the bearing is a flanged bearing. A flanged bearing has an extended edge or “flange” on one side of the outer ring, which helps in positioning the bearing axially in an assembly, preventing it from moving in the bore.
2.	“6” - This refers to the bearing type. In this case, it typically denotes a metric series deep groove ball bearing, which is the most common type of ball bearing used.
3.	“8” - This number indicates the inner diameter of the bearing in millimeters. For an F683 bearing, the inner diameter is 3 mm.
4.	“3” - This final number specifies the width (or thickness) of the bearing, also in millimeters.

### Specific Dimensions of an F683 Bearing:

- **Inner Diameter (ID):** 3 mm
- **Outer Diameter (OD):** 7 mm
- **Width (W):** 2 mm
- **Flange Diameter (FD):** Typically around 8 mm (though this can vary slightly depending on the manufacturer)
