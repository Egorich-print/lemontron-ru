These brass inserts are extra long and go in straight. The Lemontron has the inserts going in from the rear for the
maximum strength. You can use the inserts from a JourneyMaker instead, but they won't be as strong.

2 hold on the top plates, 2 hold on the idle pulley, 2 hold on the z axis, 1 holds the XY belt tensioner.
