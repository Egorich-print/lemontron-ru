NEMA17 motors have a faceplate 1.7" wide (43.2 mm). The 20mm specification refers to the depth (or length) of the motor body, excluding the shaft.

The Lemontron requires 4 of these motors, as opposed to 3 on the [JourneyMaker](https://github.com/mcfazio2001/JourneyMaker-Positron). The Lemontron design demands precision from the builder, so it's required that you cut the wires and re-crimp them! Otherwise your rats nest of wires will be too large to fit in the Lemontron's case and the electronics will overheat.
