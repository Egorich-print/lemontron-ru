NEMA stands for National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and the number “17” refers to the size of the faceplate. Specifically, a NEMA 17 motor has a faceplate size of 1.7 inches (or 43.2 mm) square. NEMA 17 motors are commonly used in 3D printers, CNC machines, and robotics due to their handy balance of size, torque, and precision. The 20mm specification refers to the depth (or length) of the motor body (excluding the shaft). This is a relatively short motor compared to other NEMA 17 stepper motors

## Builder's Notes

The Lemontron requires 4 of these motors, as opposed to 3 on the [JourneyMaker](https://github.com/mcfazio2001/JourneyMaker-Positron).

### Note: Crimping Required!
The Lemontron design demands precision from the builder, so it's required that you cut the wires and re-crimp them! Otherwise your rats nest of wires will be too large to fit in the Lemontron's case and the electronics will overheat.
