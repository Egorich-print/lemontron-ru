These 20mm NEMA17 motors have a faceplate 1.7" wide (43.2 mm) and length of 20mm of the motor body, excluding the shaft.

The Lemontron requires 4 of these motors, as opposed to 3 on
the [JourneyMaker](https://github.com/mcfazio2001/JourneyMaker-Positron). The Lemontron design demands precision from
the builder, so it's required that you cut the wires and re-crimp them! Otherwise your rats nest of wires will be too
large to fit in the Lemontron's case and the electronics will overheat.

## Required Modifications

You must cut all the motor shafts down to 11mm. Precision is not required and 10mm to 11mm is fine.
