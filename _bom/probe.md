The MicroProbe V2.0 is an ABL sensor, meaning it is used to automatically detect and compensate for tilt in the build
surface, like the various ones available from Voxolite. This helps ensure that the first layer of a print is laid down
perfectly, which is crucial for print adhesion and overall print quality.
