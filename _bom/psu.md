This part is an upgrade over the PSU found in the JourneyMaker, but if you're converting a JourneyMaker, you can use the original PSU. The LOP-300-27 is a reliable and efficient 300W 27V power supply that can power the JourneyMaker and the Lemontron. It's also a bit more expensive than the original PSU, but it's worth it for the extra power.
