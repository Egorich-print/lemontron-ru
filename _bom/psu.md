This part is an upgrade over the PSU found in the JourneyMaker, but if you're converting a JourneyMaker, you can use the
original PSU. The LOP-300-27 is a reliable and efficient 300W 27V power supply that can power the JourneyMaker and the
Lemontron. It's also a bit more expensive than the original PSU, but it's worth it for the extra power.

## Required Modification

On the AC side, you need to trim the PCB, cutting a 45-degree angle on the corners. The cut must pass through the center
of the mounting hole.
