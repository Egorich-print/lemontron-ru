A 5015 fan is a type of small cooling fan. The designation “5015” refers to the fan’s dimensions; 50mm wide and 15mm
thick.

The 5015 fan is a blower-type fan, which means it directs air perpendicular to the intake. This is
different from an axial fan, which pushes air straight through the fan. The blower design allows the 5015 fan to provide
high static pressure, making it effective at pushing air through confined spaces or over specific components, such as a
hotend in the Lemontron.

Importantly, West3D sales a much faster and stronger version of the 5015 fan, the Berserker Vindr Ultra-Performance 5015
Blower Fan
24V 5015B-24V-A 50x15mm. If this will ship to your country, it's strongly recommended!
