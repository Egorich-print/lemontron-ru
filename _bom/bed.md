Positron community member Sample Name has done most of the hard core engineering work on the Positron heat beds. The
original design is available from Voxolite, and the newest version is available from KB3D.

There are also glass beds available, which are cool looking, but they are more expensive and not as good as the PEI
beds.

Steer clear of Muon3D beds, they don't work!
