90 Degree Hotend Kit for the Positron V3.2 3D Printer Kit. From the community trusted LDO Motors. Includes heater,
bimetal heat break, and 0.4mm nozzle.

Before you get shocked by the price ($75), it’s in a its own class. It comes with a functional bimetal heat
break, has a killer design, and features an insane 75-watt heater. Plus, it’s from LDO.

That said, you can still use any tool head you want! If you have a JourneyMaker you can reuse that one.
