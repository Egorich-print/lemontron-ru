90 Degree Hotend Kit for the Positron V3.2 3D Printer Kit. From the community trusted LDO Motors. Includes heater,
bimetal heat break, and 0.4mm nozzle.

## Story Time

I really, REALLY tried to make the Voxolite hotend work, but after weeks of effort, I kept getting clogs. I
went through several bimetal and titanium heat breaks, wasting hundreds of dollars. I wanted it to work because it only
cost $40, and I wanted to support my good friend McFazio. But in the end, the one from Positron worked flawlessly on the
first try—no issues at all. In fact, it’s the reason the Lemontron is printing so well right now.

Before you get shocked by the price ($75), it’s in a completely different class. It comes with a functional bimetal heat
break, has a killer design, and features an insane 75-watt heater. Plus, it’s from LDO, who are seriously MVPs in the 3D
printing world. I’m planning to contact Nomad to see if we can negotiate a lower price, but for now, it’s officially
part of the BOM (Bill of Materials). That said, you can use any tool head you want! You don't have to use the Lemontron
tool head.
