<p>
    Lemontron fits neatly into a standard filament box, breaking boundaries and making it the perfect tool
    for makers on the go without sacrificing the performance you expect from a full-sized 3D
    printer.

<h2>Hold your horses! 🦄</h2>
<p>
    The printer is still being polished up. These guides are not quite finished. Consider them a preview. An update video is coming soon!
