                <p>
                    I personally roll with solder gang but crimps are still the goat in some situations. You need to
                    crimp
                    well, so here are my tips...
                </p>

                    <li><b>Disable the ratchet!</b> Feel the JST connector succumb to your power.</li>
                    <li><b>A crimp must BEGIN well to end well</b>. You can just start squeezing the JST and get a feel
                        for it. If it
                        buckles, it's a DUD...abort!
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Precision is key:</b> Expose just the tip of the wire, just 1mm for this tiny connector.</li>
                    <li>Insert the wire by feel primarily but LOOK AT IT WITH YOUR EYES TOO.</li>
                    <li><b>Don't practice on the motors!</b> You need to just get a feel for it and then you'll be a pro
                        crimper.
