    Lemontron fits neatly into a standard filament box, breaking boundaries and making it the perfect tool
    for makers on the go.

<p>
    Lemontron offers something brand new. Itâ€™s
    easy to assemble, disassemble, and store, without sacrificing the performance you expect from a full-sized 3D
    printer. With Lemontron, you can take your zest for printing anywhere.
